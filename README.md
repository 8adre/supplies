### Get

#### Get the supply of a native coin

    $ supplies get <driver name>

#### Get supply of a specific coin or a token
For the coin object see `lib/models/coin`

    $ supplies get <driver name> -c "<coin object>"

#### Flags


| Name     | Flag                | Description
| -------- | ------------------- | ---
| Coin     | `-c`, `--coin <type>` | For passing down a Coin object so the driver knows which reference to use as well as which modifiers
| Record   | `-r`, `--record`      | Record the requests and coin, and save them as fixtures. This is for developing purposes
| Key      | `-k`, `--key <type>`  | For passing down an API key when the driver requires one. When used in combination with the `-r` flag the key will be masked in the fixtures
| No cache | `--nocache`         | Skip using the cache
